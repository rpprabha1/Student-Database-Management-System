# Student Database Management System
 SQL+Python
The GUI is made using Tkinter library in Python.
Thought it is not widely used, its fairly simple to use.
The project is just to demonstrate the integration of Sql with python.
The PyMySql library helps to connect to the database with simple functions.
The database was set up using wamp server and using MySql workbench in the front end.
